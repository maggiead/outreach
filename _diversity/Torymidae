## Introduction
Identifiable by its long ovipositor,Torymidae is a family of wasps that have a unique metallic sheen to their bodies. Clocking in at about 2-3 mm long, Torymidae hold a multitude of genera that range from parasitizing mantis eggs to gall forming. One thing to point out is the latest developments in the Torymidae family. Prior to 2017, Torymidae was thought to contain the genus Megastigmus. However, this was disproven using taxonomy showing that Megastigmus does not belong in the Torymidae family at all!
